👋 Hello, I'm Peri!

🌍 Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about blockchain technology, decentralized systems, and open-source development. I strive to contribute to innovative projects and collaborate with like-minded individuals in the tech community.

👨‍💻 As a developer, I specialize in working with Cosmos SDK, a powerful framework for building blockchain applications. I have hands-on experience running Cosmos SDK-based validators and participating in consensus protocols. My expertise extends to developing smart contracts, implementing governance mechanisms, and building secure and scalable blockchain solutions.

🔭 Currently, I'm focused on exploring the vast possibilities of the Cosmos ecosystem and contributing to its growth. I actively engage in the Cosmos community, sharing my knowledge, insights, and experiences through discussions, forums, and technical articles.

💼 Professionally, I have a solid background in software development, with proficiency in various programming languages, including Go, Rust, and JavaScript. I'm well-versed in modern development practices, such as test-driven development, continuous integration, and agile methodologies.

🌟 Open-source collaboration is a core value for me, and I believe in the power of collective knowledge and the importance of giving back to the community. I'm enthusiastic about collaborating on impactful projects and fostering innovation through shared efforts.

📫 Feel free to reach out to me for collaboration opportunities, technical discussions, or if you have any questions related to Cosmos SDK, blockchain development, or anything else that piques your interest. Let's connect and create something awesome together!

🌱 Learning is a never-ending journey, and I'm always seeking to expand my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the blockchain space. Currently, I'm diving deeper into [mention specific areas of interest or ongoing projects].

⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding or exploring the blockchain realm, you can find me [mention a hobby or interest unrelated to tech].
